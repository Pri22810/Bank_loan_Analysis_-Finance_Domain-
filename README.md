# Bank Loan Analysis
**This project is part of a Data Analyst portfolio, focusing on analyzing bank loan data using SQL and Power BI to derive meaningful insights and create dashboards for effective decision-making.**

# Project Overview


**The Bank Loan Analysis project involves working with loan data stored in MS SQL Server, followed by creating visualizations and dashboards in Power BI. The goal is to solve various business problems by analyzing loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and loan statuses.**

# Problem Statement
**The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the bank's loan portfolio by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and creating informative dashboards:**

**Dashboard 1: Summary**

**Key Metrics:**
Total Loan Applications (MTD and MoM changes)
Total Funded Amount (MTD and MoM changes)
Total Amount Received (MTD and MoM changes)
Average Interest Rate (MTD and MoM changes)
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) (MTD and MoM changes)
Good vs. Bad Loan Analysis:
Percentage of Good Loans vs. Bad Loans
Funded Amount and Amount Received for Good vs. Bad Loans
Loan Status Grid View: Overview of loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and DTI categorized by loan status.

**Dashboard 2: Overview**

**Visualizations:**
Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map)
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)
Metrics: Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, and Received Amount.

**Dashboard 3: Details**

A comprehensive "Details Dashboard" provides a consolidated view of all essential information within the loan data, offering a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics.
